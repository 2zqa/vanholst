# VanHolst schema and logbook app

An app to track the schema and logbook of the VanHolst training website.

The following course was used to develop this app:

- [Complete Flutter Course Bundle](https://codewithandrea.com/courses/complete-flutter-bundle/)

## Project Setup

To clone the repo for the first time and open it in VSCode, run this:

```
git clone https://github.com/2zqa/complete-flutter-course.git
cd complete-flutter-course
code .
```

This will checkout the `main` branch which contains the **latest code**.

But at various points in the course, I'll ask you to checkout a **specific branch name**, so you can follow along with the right code, at the right time.

And to prevent any conflicts, you may need to reset your local changes:

```
git reset --hard HEAD
git checkout <branch-name>
```
